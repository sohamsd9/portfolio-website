# Hi, I'm Soham 👋

I am a graduate student focused on data analytics, cloud computing, and system design. I enjoy turning real-world problems into structured, data-driven solutions and building systems that actually work in production, not just on paper.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across:
- **Manufacturing & operations** – optimizing processes, reducing shortages, and automating workflows.
- **Data analytics & machine learning** – building models, dashboards, and insights to support decisions.

## Career Goals

My goal is to work in roles that sit at the intersection of **data, systems, and business**—such as:

- Data / Business / Analytics Engineer

Long term, I want to design data and cloud platforms that help organizations make faster, smarter decisions and scale confidently.

Outside academics, I’m involved in:
- Family business initiatives around **manufacturing and LED/OEM** products  
- Hands-on experimentation with new tools, cloud platforms, and personal projects
